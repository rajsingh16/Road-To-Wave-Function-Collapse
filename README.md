# Road-To-Wave-Function-Collapse
#### This is a repo recording my progress in wave function collapse using python!
After watching the video on Wave Function Collapse, on the You-Tube channel 'The Coding Train', I made up my mind to create this program.
So, I am making my way towards it!
## Part 1 - Random Map Generator
The first part in this algo was a random map generator. A program that takes few roads as inputs and generates a maze like pattern based on simple set of rules!

Although, my current algo is less spontaneous, it is fine for now. 
I will however work on improving it, and making it to be more spontaneous.
The other limitations to this algo is that, it is designed particularly for a fixed set of grid. That is, if you want output to be of 5x5 grid, you will need to include more grids. By default it works for 3x3.
My next, step is to make it more sponataneous and workble for user speific grids.
## Part 2 - Soduko Solver
