# Road-To-Wave-Function-Collapse
#### This is a repo recording my progress in wave function collapse using python!
After watching the video on Wave Function Collapse, on the You-Tube channel 'The Coding Train', I made up my mind to create this program.
So, I am making my way towards it!
## Part 1 - Random Map Generator
The first part in this algo was a random map generator. A program that takes few roads as inputs and generates a maze like pattern based on simple set of rules!
Although, my current algo is less spontaneous, it is fine for now. 
I will however work on improving it, and making it to be more spontaneous.
